# alternating-line-color
I built this from the sample shown in 10-4 Episode 5: Code Focused in Visual Studio 2010Â by Drew Robbins, he covers this bit about 13 minutes into his video. simply put it gives you alternating light and dark lines for code like back in the good old days when your code came back from processing in the mainframe or mini computer on piano ruled green listing paper.
